- title: STAC item with link to provenance
  content: |
    This is the simple item example from the STAC specification, augmented with the simplest possible form of provenance - a link to a resource that provides provenance details. 

    a STAC item is a prov:Entity with the "wasGeneratedBy" property defined by PROV-O.

    This is the simple item example from the STAC specification, augmented a description of the activity that generated it, with nested set of entities the object derives from. 

    A STAC item is a prov:Entity with the "wasGeneratedBy" property defined by PROV-O.

- title: STAC item with a provenance graph
  content: |
    This is the simple item example from the STAC specification, augmented an array of Provenance objects that define a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that can fully describe a set of contributing activities, entities and agents.) 

    A STAC item is a prov:Entity with the "has_provenance" property whose range is an array of objects defined by the PROV-O model.

    - language: json
